# Learning process for DS/A
## Basics
- What is it?  
  - A way to store multiple elements in a single object
- How is it represented in code?
  - arr[0] or arr.at(0)
- What operations can be performed?
  - .length is generally standard
  - .push() / .pop() / .splice() / .sort() / .reverse() /.concat() / .includes() / .indexOf() / .map() / .reduce() / etc... are nice but not available in all languages
- What is the overall time complexity?
  - O(1) for access / O(n) for insertion & deletion
    - ***note:*** this can increase if the array needs to be resized to perform the operation
## Applications
- Where is it used in the real world?
  - Essentially everywhere programs exist
  - How / why should be self-explanatory for this one
## Visualization
- Whiteboard the solution
  - Diagrams
  - Flowcharts
  - Pseudocode
## Code from scratch
- Implement your understanding of all the steps above in code
## Code w/ libraries
- Learn if the given language has built in tools for the problem (e.g. Java HashMap or TreeSet)
- Implement using those libraries if applicable
- Compare with your solution
## Problems
- Practice using the learned tool in a useful scenario
- Is there other code you've written that you can refactor to utilize it?
- 4/5 easy leetcode problems to hammer home the idea

# Useful Tips
- Prioritize solving problems -- not theory
- Solve harder problems each time
- Don't memorize -- try to truly understand
- Think about the patterns -- "What type of situation is this tool generally good for?"
- Use SRS
  - Solve problem with any reference material needed
  - 1+ day break
  - Solve problem without looking at solutions
  - 3+ day break
  - Solve problem without reference material
  - 7+ day break
  - Solve problem without reference material
  - 14+ day break
  - Solve problem entirely from memory
